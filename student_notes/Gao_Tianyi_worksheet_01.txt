A friend presents you with a coin they claim to be fair. You flip the coin 5 times and it lands on Heads every single time. You flip the coin another 5 times, same result. How many times must this happen for you to start doubting the fair toss of the coin? Explain your reasoning a bit. 
Answer: The probability of getting a head for a fair coin is 0.5. After flipping a fair coin 10 times and getting heads every time, the probability of this happening is about 0.098%. This is quite low, and well below common statistical thresholds for doubt (like 5% or 1%). Therefore, it would be reasonable to start doubting the fairness of the coin after observing 10 consecutive heads.
