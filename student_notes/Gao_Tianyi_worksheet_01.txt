Answer: The probability of getting a head for a fair coin is 0.5. After flipping a fair coin 10 times and getting heads every time, the probability of this happening is about 0.098%. This is quite low, and well below common statistical thresholds for doubt (like 5% or 1%). Therefore, it would be reasonable to start doubting the fairness of the coin after observing 10 consecutive heads.
